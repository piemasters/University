Case Study – UweFlix Cinema Booking System

1. Background and required System Goal

The famous and fictitious UweFlix cinema on Frenchay Campus has a limited ticketing system in place currently. However, to enable customers to place advance bookings, UweFlix Inc. have decided to put in place a Cinema Booking System to complement the current system. The goal of the Cinema Booking system is to enable customers (students, staff and their families) to purchase cinema tickets in advance of the showing electronically.
 
2. Requirements

Initial analysis reveals that System Actors include:
•	Customer
•	Cinema Manager

Initial analysis also reveals the following use case scenarios -

(1) Customer scenarios:

Purchase Advance Tickets
The customer selects a date and is provided with a list of showings for that 
date, including the time of the showings. The customer selects a showing and 
is provided with details of the showing, including film title, age rating, 
duration, and a short trailer description.  The customer then selects the 
quantity of tickets required, together with the ticket type. Ticket types 
may be one of student, child, or adult.  The total cost of the booking is 
supplied to the customer. If the customer is happy, they then confirm their 
booking request.

If there are insufficient seats available at the showing, the booking request 
is cancelled and the customer is invited to make a further booking request. If 
there are sufficient seats, the customer confirms the booking and enters their 
payment card details, which include card number and expiry date. Payment cards 
may be one of two types – credit card or payment card. The payment is transacted.  

Collect Tickets
On entry to the UweFlix cinema, the customer swipes their payment card through 
an attractive and easy to use swipe / printer device which determines the 
current booking details for the payment card. If a booking currently exists 
for the payment card, the swipe / printer device prints the appropriate tickets 
for the booking. 


(2) Cinema Manager scenarios:

Add Film
The cinema manager adds details of a new film. Film details include Title, Age Rating, Duration, and short trailer description.

Delete Film
The cinema manager requests to delete details of an obsolete film. The film can only be deleted if there are no showings allocated to it.

Add Screen
The cinema manager adds details of a new screen in the cinema. Screen details include the capacity of the screen in terms of the numbers of seats.

Add Showing
The cinema manager adds details of a new showing of a film. Showing details include the date and time of the showing. (Showing details must also be able to record the number of tickets sold against the showing at any time). 

Cancel Showing
The cinema manager requests to delete a showing. A showing can only be deleted if there are no tickets sold for the showing.
