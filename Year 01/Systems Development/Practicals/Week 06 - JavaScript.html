<b>The aim of this worksheet is:</b></h3>

<ul>
<li>
Deepen your understanding of JavaScript</li>
<li>
Learn to write simple JavaScripts</li>

<li>
Encourage you to self-learn by following references to further help</li>

<li>
Develop the skills required for your assignment</li>
</ul>

<h3>

<hr></h3>

<h2>
Review</h2>

<h3>
You should make sure that you are familiar with the JavaScript
<a href="lect6_47_20_1.pdf">lecture notes</a>.</h3>

<h2>
References</h2>

<p>
Make sure you follow the references to further help in the lecture notes and 
bookmark them - they you may want to spend some time on them over Xmas.</p>

<h2>
Exercise 1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Make an html page in your own web space by copying the first simple example from the lecture note (<code>Mr 
Pudding says ..</code>). I have saved this HTML file as
  <a href="javascript/hiThere.html">hiThere.html</a></li>
  <li>Save the page and give it correct permissions</li>
  <li>Check that you can load the page into the browser using http: protocol</li>
  <li>Edit the page to make Mr Pudding tell you how he is feeling today!</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Exercise 2</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Make a page with the next example (<code>Ms 
Pud speaks ..</code>). Saved as: <a href="javascript/hiThereHead.html">
  hiThereHead.html</a></li>
  <li>Check that you can load the page into the browser using <code>http:</code> protocol</li>
  <li>Write another <b>function</b> called <code>sayHello</code> - when you call
  <code>sayHello</code> with a name (e.g. <code>Jay</code>) it should write out
  <code>&quot;Hello</code> <code>Jay&quot;</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>
Exercise 3</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Do the same with the <b>popups</b> example - you will need to save or link 
  to  image files. You can read the HTML source to find where this image 
  file is! Saved as: <a href="javascript/popups.html">popups.html</a></li>
  <li>Check that you can load the page into the browser using <code>http:</code> protocol</li>
  <li>When you hover the mouse over the image some text appears - where does 
  this come from? Change this text to read &quot;<code>Click me nicely!</code>&quot;</li>
  <li>When you click <code>Cancel</code> after being asked to talk the pop box 
  says <code>Sob ...</code>, instead of this pop up another box saying &quot;<code>I 
  insist you speak to me!</code>&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Exercise 4</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Run the rollover example in your own web space- Saved as:
  <a href="javascript/rollover.html">rollover.html</a></li>
  <li>Change the images for 2 that you have made or got from elsewhere (they are 
  MANY free images on the internet - use a search engine)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Exercise 5 (DIFFICULT)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Finally - back to the first example - days to xmas... Saved as:
  <a href="javascript/xmas.html">xmas.html</a></li>
  <li>Change this so that it calculates how many days to your birthday!</li>
  <li>What happens if your birthday has already passed this year? After you have 
  set your birthday 

<p>
<code>xmas.setFullYear(today.getFullYear());</code></p>

<p>
you can add the following code to add one to the year if your birthday has 
already passed!</p>

<p>
<code>if ( xmas.getTime() &lt; today.getTime() ) {<br>
&nbsp;
//xmas has gone this year<br>
&nbsp;
xmas.setFullYear(today.getFullYear() +1 );<br>
}</code></p>

<p>
Of course, this still refers to Xmas - you will need to change this to refer to 
your birthday.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
