   	  	<div class="grid_12 text bold">Are taxes included in the price of my fare?</div>
        
		<div class="grid_12 text">The price of the tickets includes taxes and fees which are imposed on air transportation by government authorities. Taxes and fees, which may represent a significant portion of the cost of air travel are either included in the fare or shown separately in the "TAX" box.</div>
        
   	  	<div class="grid_12 text bold">Is my ticket refundable or transferable?</div>
        
		<div class="grid_12 text">Unfortunately tickets are NOT refundable or transferable. Is my ticket changeable? Yes, your ticket is changeable, but will result in penalties and possibly increased fares.</div>    
        
        <div class="grid_12 text bold">Is any type of cancellation insurance available?</div>
        
		<div class="grid_12 text">No, cancellation insurance is not available.</div>   
        
        <div class="grid_12 text bold">What services are offered for children traveling alone?</div>
        
		<div class="grid_12 text">Unaccompanied children, ten years or older, are accepted for most airline transportation. For a fee of Â£30, an airline customer service agent will escort your child on and off the aircraft. All unaccompanied children will be escorted from point of check-in to the airplane where the child is placed in the care of a flight attendant. A parent MUST be present at check-in when their children are traveling alone.</div>    
        
        <div class="grid_12 text bold">Do I have to pay full fare for an infant?</div>
        
		<div class="grid_12 text">An infant is a child under two years of age not occupying a seat. Once children reach their second birthday, they must be seated in an approved seat. One infant is permitted to travel free for each passenger paying adult fare who is at least 12 years of age. Each additional child under 2 years of age accompanying the same adult passenger will pay full fare.</div>  
        
        <div class="grid_12 text bold">Should I check-in at the gate?</div>
        
		<div class="grid_12 text">If you have reserved a seat, you must check-in. Reserved seats are subject to cancellation if not claimed at least 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure time.</div>   
        
        <div class="grid_12 text bold">What is required when I check-in?</div>
        
		<div class="grid_12 text">ALL ticketed passengers must show positive identification at check-in. Children must have a parent present at check-in. Tickets must be in each passenger's name.</div>
